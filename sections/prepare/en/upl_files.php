<h3>Uploading Drupal engine to a server</h3>
<p>If you extract files locally on your computer, you will need to upload them to a hosting server.</p>
<p>Drupal engine should be uploaded to the root directory of your hosting server. Usually it is named
	<strong>WWW</strong> or <strong>public_html</strong>. If you are not sure about the root directory name, contact
	your hosting provider for more information.</p>
<p>You can upload files to a server using programs for managing files, like FileZilla, TotalCommander, etc. There is
	also a number of browsers add-ons (e.g. FireFTP for Mozilla Firefox). Moreover some hosting providers offer the file
	manager option. Please, check your control panel or contact your hosting provider for more details.</p>
